Hello everyone, i don't know if someone will see this someday, but, i'm really proud of what i've done. I actually took some time to do this project for my CS50 course, it does have some bugs, but i don't know, feel like the JOB IS DONE, you know? 

Well, probably is very fun to read this but. Anyways, i'm sure i'll be back here any day soon so, i'll probably laugh myself aswell. 

Hope everyone seeing this is doing fine, and I hope you accomplish all your goals :)
